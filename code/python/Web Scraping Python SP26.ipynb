    "Web scraping is a way to collect information from websites using code. It can be especially useful when working with data that isn’t easily downloadable. There are several approaches and tools for web scraping—this workshop will focus on one of them: Python’s Beautiful Soup package. Python is an open-source language, so with the right setup, anyone can use this tool.\n",

    "Web scraping can support different stages of the research data lifecycle, including the planning phase (e.g., identifying available online data) and the active data collection phase. This workshop is intended for those who are new to web scraping and want to explore how it can be used in a research context.\n",
